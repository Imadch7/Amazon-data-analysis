# Amazon Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on Amazon data, likely involving business intelligence (BI) techniques to explore sales, customer behavior, or product performance metrics. The project demonstrates skills in data processing, visualization, and insights generation using tools like Python, SQL, or BI software.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of key metrics (e.g., sales trends, top products)
- Potential BI dashboard or reports

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (if Jupyter notebooks are used)
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn, plotly (install via `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly`)
- Dataset: Amazon-related CSV or other data files (included in repo)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Imadch7/Amazon-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Amazon-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Create a `requirements.txt` file if not present by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing libraries.)

## Usage
1. Open the main notebook or script (e.g., `amazon_analysis.ipynb` or `main.py`).
2. Load the dataset (e.g., `amazon_data.csv`).
3. Run the cells or script to perform analysis and generate visualizations.
4. Explore the output files, such as charts or reports in the `/outputs` directory.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('amazon_data.csv')
print(df.head())
# Proceed with analysis...
```

## Files Structure
- `/data/`: Raw and processed datasets (e.g., CSV files with Amazon sales data).
- `/notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling.
- `/scripts/`: Python scripts for Generate plots and dashboards.
- `/vedio, /reports`: Generate video for description and reports.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
